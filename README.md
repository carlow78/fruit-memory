# **Fruit Memory**

Is a memory card game designed to improve short-term memory and exercise the brain. Its a game that can be enjoyed by young and old.

The game was designed using the mobile first development model with additional media queries for devices with larger screens.

<i>Why Mobile First?</i> Over half of website traffic comes from mobile devices and over 90% of internet users access the internet using a mobile phone. <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/mobile-internet-traffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a>

The below screenshot shows what the game looks like in various screensizes.

# User Experience (UX)

## User Stories

As a user I want to ...

* be able to see instructions about how to play the game.
* be able to start a New Game.
* see all the cards turned over at the start of the game.
* a timer to start as soon as I click on the first card.
* move counter to increase each time I try to make a match.
* pair counter to increase when I find a matching pair.
* close button on the pop-up windows to close them.
* receive feedback when I find all pairs regarding my time and Moves made.
* finally, I expect the cards to appear in random order when I play a new game.

## Wireframes

The wireframes for Fruit Memory were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). As I started developing the game and looking for inspiration. The final game does differ but the idea remains the same.

## Design Choices

* ### Game Design

The goal of the project was to build a fun and interactive game that can be enjoyed by the young and old. A timer is featured so they can try to improve on their quickest time. Also featured are a move counter (each time two cards are turned counts as a move) and a pair matched counter. When the pairs matched reaches the maximum of 8 the game ends and feedback is provided to the player.

* ### Why choose a memory game?

The benefits of playing memory games are many (Source Google search - memory card game benefits):

  *  Improve concentration.
  *  Improve short-memory.
  *  Enhance critical thinking.
  *  Improve attention span.
  *  Can be enjoyed by the young and old. 

* ### Font

The font chosen was 'Didact Gothic' from Google Font (https://fonts.google.com/). For the text I decided to use a Shadow effect in CSS to make the text pop out on screen.

Sans-serif is used as a fallback and as the text for modal pop-ups (How to Play and End game) with Didact Gothic used to display Move and Time taken variables to make them stand out.

 * ### Game background

The background I choose I found after numerous searches for a fruit background that wouldn't distract from the card canvas area. I eventually settled on the below image.

### Color palettes

I decided to use canva palette generator (https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) when looking for colors to match the above background.

## Game characters

The game features 8 cartoon fruit characters from Freepik.com. To make the game more appealing to the young generation.

## Deck card cover

The deck card cover was designed using Microsoft Paint 3D. It is a similar size to the above images. A rainbow was chosen to match the different colors of the fruit characters and appeal to younger players.

# Game Features

### Game canvas

The game features 4 x 4 squares. The 16 squares fit neatly onto smaller mobile screens. Media queries were added to increase the canvas and card sizes for larger screens.

![Game canvas ](assets/readme/game-canvas.png)

### Game tracking

The game features 3 elements

1. Timer (activated when first card is clicked).
2. Moves counter (to track the number of times a player tries to match 2 cards).
3. Pairs matched (increases each time 2 cards are matched).

![Game canvas](assets/readme/game-tracking.png)


### Modal (Pop-Ups)

The game features 2 pop-up windows which both appear over the playing area.

1. How to play
2. End Game

<b>How to Play</b>

This pop-up is activated when the player clicks on the ![New Game button](assets/readme/new-game-button.png) button. Underneath the deck of   cards.

It explains the rules of the game and how to play.

![How to Play](assets/readme/game-rules-modal.png)

<b>End Game</b>

This pop-up appears immediately after the player finds the final 8th pair of cards.

It congratulates them on the achievement and provides feedback regarding the time they have taken and the number of moves.

## Future Features 

* Flip card functioning
* A leaderboard for quickest time and least moves made
* Audio for different languages when cards a flipped to add language learning element to game. I.e when the apple card is flipped the spanish for apple (manzana) is played
* Ability to disable audio for above
* Text description of cards for a different language ie - manzana underneath apple.jpg
This element would work on larger screens

# Technologies Used
* [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) - provides the content and structure for the website.
* [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript) - scripting language and primary element of PP2.
* [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) - provides the styling.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) - was used to create the wireframes.
* [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - was used to code locally.
* [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - was installed and used to track changes made locally. Summary and comments were added for each commit added to Github.
* [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) - was installed to push changes to github made locally using Visual Studio and managed by Github Desktop.
* [Github](https://github.com/) - was used to store the project's webpages and images. After every session I pushed the updates to github for further validation and testing.
